summary: 'How to enable any text editor to work with git commands'

I'm joining the party a little late, but I've started working with `git` and `GitHub`, both for this website, and coincidentally at work for my current project.This is a quick article about using your favorite editor to write your commit messages.

## State of the art

If you happen to work with `git` (if not, you should download and it and play with it, it's marvelous), you probably need to enter a commit message at some point. When you first setup your environment, no default editor is configured (on OSX, if `git` is installed with XCode, it might use `vim` as the default editor).

Checking out what is configured, it is as easy as invoking this line in the Terminal:

```bash
$ git config core.editor
vim
```

Chances are, you will get an empty line as nothing is probably set.

## Change the editor

Let's say you want to use SublimeText 3. This software comes with a very handy multiplatform (Windows and OSX) CLI call `subl`, that you can invoke in the Terminal. To use it anywhere in your command line, you either have to put the path of the executable into the `PATH` variable of the Windows environment, or do a symlink on OSX (see Resources).

Open up a Terminal then type `subl`, you should see that it will open a new Sublime window. There is a bunch of optional parameters that you can pass to interact with Sublime, like `-n` for opening up a new window, or `-w` to wait for the files to be closed before returning.

To change the editor settings, use this command in the Terminal:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"
```

Now every time the command `git commit` will be invoked, SublimeText will be the default editor for commit messages.
